# Mobile Robotics Projects
In the following link you will find my public blog where I described some projects I made in *Unibotics*. These projects are the followings:
1. Vaccum cleaner using FSM (Finite State Machines) and pseudo-random behavior.
2. Follow line in a Formula 1 car using color filtering and other tools.
3. Obstacle avoidance of a Formula 1 car using VFF algorithm (Virtual Forces Fields).
4. Global Navigation of a Taxi in a city using GPP algorithm (Global Path Planning)
